My coursework and portfolio development have marked a transition from writing functional code to engineering professional-grade software solutions. Through the refactoring and enhancement of three distinct artifacts, I have demonstrated a comprehensive ability to optimize for performance, scalability, and maintainability.

My work on the Android Weight Tracking Application highlights my ability to elevate a functional prototype into a maintainable software product. I recognized that while "making it work" is the first step, "making it maintainable" is the true engineering standard. I successfully implemented the Contract Pattern to resolve issues with hardcoded SQL strings, eliminating "magic strings" and significantly reducing the risk of runtime errors caused by typos. This centralization of constants ensures that future changes propagate automatically, making the codebase scalable for new features like BMI calculation. I also modernized the application by migrating from legacy layouts to Material Design 3, establishing a consistent visual hierarchy and brand identity. By defining semantic colors and high-contrast elements, I ensured the application meets industry standards for accessibility and user experience.

In enhancing the Animal Shelter system, I demonstrated the ability to analyze and resolve high-level performance constraints. I identified that the original linear search algorithms created bottlenecks that hindered scalability. I replaced the inefficient linear search, which had a time complexity of roughly $O(M \cdot N)$, with an Inverted Index data structure. By mapping filter values to index sets and performing Set Intersections, I shifted the complexity closer to $O(K)$, where $K$ is the result set size. This optimization significantly improved the dashboard's responsiveness, showcasing my proficiency in managing large datasets efficiently.

My work on the ContactService and TaskService components focused on transforming single-threaded implementations into production-ready, thread-safe services. This project refined my understanding of how data persistence interacts with system memory in high-concurrency environments. I upgraded the underlying data structure from a standard HashMap to a ConcurrentHashMap to prevent memory corruption during simultaneous read/write operations. I eliminated race conditions by replacing two-step existence checks with atomic operations using putIfAbsent. This guarantees that duplicate IDs cannot be created, regardless of server load. I introduced centralized helper methods and immediate input validation to enforce the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle and prevent null objects from causing runtime errors.

These enhancements collectively demonstrate my evolution as a software engineer. I have moved beyond simply storing data to considering how it is accessed under stress, and from writing code that functions to writing code that is resilient, scalable, and secure. I am confident in my ability to identify architectural weaknesses and implement robust solutions that adhere to modern industry standards.
